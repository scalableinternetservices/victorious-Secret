Have you ever needed some job to be done at your place and spent hours searching for someone who can do the job for you?? May be fix your bathroom, clean your house or even walk your dog?? We plan to build such a platform where  people who need some job to be done post about their requirements and the amount they are willing to pay. The service providers who are interested in providing such a service can then start bidding. If they think what the user is willing to pay is too less, they can bid some amound higher and we will suggest the best service providers to the user, depending on their reliability, previous experience of other users with those service providers etc. It can be called 'an uber for anything' :p
